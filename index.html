          <i><b>" I am an engineering student who is very fond of science and technology since my childhood, I scored very good marks in Computer Science in high school(98/100) as well as in intermediate(94/100).
        I am very fond of Physics especially. I am a hardworking and workoholic guy. I prepared for IIT entrance exam so I know the meaning of hardwork and discipline.
        I am very confident person. I love to travel, I have been to a lot of places. I am a tech enthusiast as well. "</b></i>
        <p>I prepared for jee for 2 years and got 48 percentile and then decided to take a drop for one year and to give one more
           chance to myself and this time my score improved but not enough to get into IITs or NITs this time I scored only 86 percentile but after that failure
           I didn’t stopped there, I started learning python, c++ and web
            development just after giving JEE without wasting a day. I have made quite a lot of progress in my coding journey and now I know that skills are the only
          things which are gonna help me in the long run.</p>
